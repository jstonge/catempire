## The Catalog Empire

Small repo where im thinking about how LLMs like llama2 are seeing course objects in course catalogs.

`courses.txt` contains the course objects annotated in the REA project (as of 2024-04-11; see Label-Studio for the people who know what im talking about).

Each line is a course object. You don't know where they come from. You only have (noisy) texts of course catalogs.
